# UK-Rail-Chellenge

Excited to present my submission for the hashtag#MavenRailChallenge by Maven Analytics! 🚆🔍.
For this challenge I decided to practice the Power BI and SVG integration, developing a National Rail dashboard with the main visuals that are made with this technique, mixed with core visuals elements. 

🤝Business Objectives:-
- Identify the most popular routes.
- Determine peak travel times.
- Analyze revenue from different ticket types & classes.
- Diagnose on-time performance and contributing factors.

🛠️Tools:-
PowerBI, Figma

📊 Key Findings:-
- Tickets and Revenue Overview:-
Total Tickets: 31,065K
Total Revenue: $703,219K
- Popular Routes Analysis:-
The Manchester Piccadilly to Liverpool Lime Street route is the most frequently travelled with 4,338 trips. However, this route does not generate the highest revenue.
- Peak Travel Times:-
Morning Peak (6 AM - 8 AM): 7,497 trips, largely driven by commuters heading to work.
Evening Peak (4 PM - 6 PM): 7,708 trips, as commuters return home.
Off-Peak Times: Night (7 PM - 5 AM) and midday (9 AM - 3 PM) see considerably fewer trips.
- Revenue from Ticket Types and Classes:-
Standard Class tickets generate substantially more revenue compared to First Class tickets.
Among ticket types, Advance tickets lead in revenue generation. Specifically, Advance (Standard Class) tickets account for £229,373 in revenue.
- Cancellations and Delays:-
Cancelled Trips: 1,880, with 'Signal Failure' being the predominant reason.
Delayed Trips: 2,292, with 'Weather Conditions' causing delays in 927 trips and leading to over 1,600 hours of delay.
- On-Time Performance:- 
Approximately 27,000 trips (92% of successful journeys and 86% of all bookings) were on time.
Disruptions were relatively infrequent, with 2,292 delayed trips and 1,880 cancellations.

📈Recommendations:-
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested:-
traveller Enhance Popular Routes: Increase the frequency and capacity of trains on routes with high demand to serve passengers better.

Optimize Scheduling: Adjust schedules to align with peak travel periods and deploy additional staff during these times to improve service efficiency.
Adjust Pricing Strategies: Reevaluate pricing on routes with high revenue potential to optimize profitability.

Invest in Infrastructure: Focus on improving infrastructure and incorporating advanced technology to minimize delays, particularly those caused by signal failures and adverse weather conditions.

Improve Customer Experience: Implement proactive measures to effectively manage delays and cancellations effectively, enhancing overall customer satisfaction and trust.
